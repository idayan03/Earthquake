		<p>The United States Geological Survey (USGS) records earthquake occurrences from all over the world and updates all data every 30 minutes. Data collected include, and are not restricted to, time of occurrence, latitude, longitude, and magnitude. These information provide valuable information to response agencies, who often use earthquake data to properly allocate emergency resources. Scientists also use earthquake data to determine how various types of occurrences affect certain areas and predict potential earthquakes in the future. This data is also useful for engineers to consider, because it is important to consider how building structures are affected by earthquakes. </p>

		<p> This project is designed to visualize earthquake occurrences at various period intervals, using  data collected from the USGS. Occurrences are mapped based on latitude, longitude and  sized based on magnitude of the earthquake. </p>
